    Dependency-Check can analyze Windows .NET, EXE, and DLL files when an analysis job is performed on Windows.
    On non-Windows systems, this requires the use of <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>. This setting
    expects the full path and filename for the mono binary. (i.e. /usr/bin/mono) This setting is not required on
    Windows systems, and is optional on non-Windows systems.
