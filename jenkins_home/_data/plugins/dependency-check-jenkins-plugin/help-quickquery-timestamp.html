        If enabled, Dependency-Check will use the HTTP HEAD method to retrieve timestamp information
        during the NVD update process. This is the default behaviour. Some firewalls may not be
        configured to support HTTP HEAD. Disabling this feature will force timestamp lookups to
        use HTTP GET instead.
