    Specifies the optional data mirroring scheme. By default, Dependency-Check will utilize NIST CPE/CVE data directly
    from the Internet. Dependency-Check may optionally be configured to obtain this data by mirroring NIST CPE/CVE
    data. This method requires a mirror of NIST server data by creating copies of NIST XML data, potentially modifying
    their contents and serving them via a URL.
