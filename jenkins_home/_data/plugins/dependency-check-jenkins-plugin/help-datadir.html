        If specified, Dependency-Check will create and utilize this directory for
        it's data directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data directory typically contains the embedded H2 database with all NVD
        vulnerabilities along with Lucene indexes for fast and efficient searching.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data directory resolution occurs as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Each job automatically inherits the globally defined data directory
                (if specified)</li>
            <li>The data directory can independently be controlled on a per-job basis,
                overriding the global value</li>
            <li>If neither a global or per-job data directory is specified,
                'dependency-check-data' will be created in the projects workspace</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
