    The base directory to scan. If empty, the workspace will be used by default.
    Dependency-Check will scan this directory and all subdirectories thereof. Paths may
    contain Jenkins environment variables such as ${WORKSPACE} and ${BUILD_NUMBER}.
    <p>
        Multiple scan paths may be defined by separating the paths with a comma (i.e. dir1, dir2, dir3)
    </p>
    <p>
        Paths may also be defined using Ant-style pattern sets. For example:
        <ul>
            <li>**/commons*.jar</li>
            <li>**/*com*.jar</li>
            <li>**/*dir*/*.jar</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
