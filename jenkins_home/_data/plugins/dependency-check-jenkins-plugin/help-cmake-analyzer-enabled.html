    If enabled, Dependency-Check will analyze CMake build files, and collect information that
    can be used to determine the associated CPE.
    <p>
        This analyzer catches straightforward invocations of the project command, plus some other
        observed patterns of version inclusion in real CMake projects. Many projects make use of
        older versions of CMake and/or use custom "homebrew" ways to insert version information.
        As newer CMake call patterns grows in usage, this analyzer will allow more CPEs to be
        identified.
