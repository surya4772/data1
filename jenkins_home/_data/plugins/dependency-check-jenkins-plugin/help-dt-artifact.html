    Specifies the artifact to upload. Dependency-Track supports uploading of Dependency-Check
    XML scan results and the uploading of <a href="http://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a> and
    <a href="https://spdx.org/">SPDX</a> bill-of-material documents. For Dependency-Check results
    on a multi-module project, the aggregate should be used. Paths may contain Jenkins environment
    variables such as ${WORKSPACE} and ${BUILD_NUMBER}.
