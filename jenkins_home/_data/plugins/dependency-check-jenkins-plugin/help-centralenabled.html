        If enabled, the Maven Central analyzer will run as part of a Dependency-Check scan.
        The Maven Central analyzer will search Maven Central for the SHA-1 hash of the dependency.
        If found, the groupId, artifactId, and version are added as Vendor, Product,
        and Version evidence, respectively. Furthermore, it adds a new Identifier with
        the Maven coordinates for the jar identified.
