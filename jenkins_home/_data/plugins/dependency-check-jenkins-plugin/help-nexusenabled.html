        If enabled, the Nexus Pro analyzer will run as part of a Dependency-Check scan.
        The Nexus Pro analyzer will search the repository for the SHA-1 hash of the dependency.
        If found, the groupId, artifactId, and version are added as Vendor, Product,
        and Version evidence, respectively. Furthermore, it adds a new Identifier with
        the Maven coordinates for the jar identified.
    </p><p>
    When used with an internal Nexus Pro repository, non-Maven jars (such as vendor-provided libraries, etc.)
    can be identified with greater accuracy.
