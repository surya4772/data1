    If enabled, Dependency-Check will submit package.json files to Node Security Platform
    for external analysis. Reported vulnerabilities will be integrated into Dependency-Check
    reports. This analyzer requires Internet access along with a Java runtime compatible with
    the TLS version and cipher specifications used by the Node Security Platform API.
