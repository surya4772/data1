<p>This option is only relevant if the "Build Current Patches Only" is checked.</p>
<p>If this is enabled, builds triggered with topic will be aborted when a new patch set with the same topic arrives.</p>
<p>If build was triggered by renaming topic the builds with old topic name will be aborted.</p>
<p>Be aware that manual triggers will cancel other running builds for the same topic.</p>
<p>Also if this option is enabled "Abort new patch sets" is not checked for changes with topic</p>
